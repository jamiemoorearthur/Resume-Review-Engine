# CV Reviewer AI

An AI-powered CV review platform that analyses your resume against a real job description and returns structured, actionable feedback. Built with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, semantic search, and GPT-4o to give feedback that is grounded in real hiring criteria, not generic advice.

| | URL |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | [cviq27.vercel.app](https://cviq27.vercel.app/) |
| **Backend API** | [cv-reviewer-api.onrender.com/docs](https://cv-reviewer-api.onrender.com/docs) |

> Note: The backend runs on Render's free tier and spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request may take 30 seconds to wake up.

---

## What it does

Upload a CV (PDF) and paste a job description. The system returns:

```json
{
  "overall_score": 75,
  "ats_score": 70,
  "role_alignment": "Good",
  "missing_keywords": ["Django", "PostgreSQL", "OpenAPI", "OAuth2"],
  "strengths": ["Strong Python and backend experience"],
  "weaknesses": ["No evidence of production daemon or background worker experience"],
  "suggested_bullets": [
    {
      "original": "Built AI chatbot using FastAPI",
      "improved": "Built and deployed a FastAPI-based AI chatbot with prompt-injection filtering, structured logging and Docker support, reducing customer queries by 22%."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## How it works

The system uses a RAG pipeline to ground every piece of feedback in a curated knowledge base rather than relying on the model's general knowledge alone.

```
CV (PDF)  +  Job Description (text)
        |
        v
  Text Extraction (pypdf)
        |
        v
  Chunking + Embedding (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
        |
        v
  ChromaDB Semantic Search
  (retrieves relevant rubric, ATS rules, bullet examples)
        |
        v
  GPT-4o-mini (CV + JD + retrieved context)
        |
        v
  Structured JSON Review
        |
        v
  React Frontend (scores, keywords, strengths, bullet rewrites)
```

![RAG Architecture](images/ragarch.PNG)

**Knowledge base sources loaded into ChromaDB at startup:**
- CV review rubric (7 scoring categories with weighted criteria)
- ATS guidelines (keyword strategy, formatting rules, score thresholds)
- Strong bullet point examples (before/after rewrites with structure rules)
- Role matching criteria (tech stack requirements by role across 7 job families)

## LLMOps

The pipeline is instrumented end-to-end with production-grade observability, evaluation, and guardrails — the same tooling used in commercial AI systems.

### Observability — Langfuse

Every request is traced in [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/):

| Span | What is captured |
|---|---|
| **Trace** | CV length, JD length, prompt version — one trace per review request |
| **Retrieval span** | Chunks retrieved, chunks dropped by relevance threshold, distance scores |
| **Generation** | Full prompt sent to GPT, raw response, token usage, estimated cost per call |

### RAG evaluation — Ragas

A [Ragas](https://ragas.io/) evaluation suite runs against a golden dataset of synthetic CV/JD pairs every Monday at 9am UTC via GitHub Actions:

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Faithfulness** | Are review claims grounded in the retrieved knowledge base context? |
| **Answer Relevancy** | Is the feedback relevant to the specific CV and job description submitted? |
| **Context Precision** | Are the retrieved chunks actually useful for generating the correct answer? |
| **Context Recall** | Does the retrieved context cover everything in the expected answer? |

Run manually:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-eval.txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python tests/eval/run_eval.py
```

### Prompt versioning

System prompts live as versioned text files (`prompts/system_v1.0.0.txt`) and are loaded at runtime. The active version is set via the `PROMPT_VERSION` environment variable and attached to every Langfuse trace — so prompt changes can be correlated with score regressions without redeploying.

### Relevance threshold

Before any chunks reach the LLM, a cosine distance filter drops retrievals with distance > 0.8. Weak matches are logged and recorded in the Langfuse span so you can see exactly what the retriever discarded and why.

### Token and cost logging

After every GPT call, token usage and estimated cost are printed to the server logs and attached to the Langfuse generation:

```
[tokens] prompt=1842 completion=312 total=2154 cost=$0.0005
```

### Output gate

The JSON response is scanned for hallucination markers (`"as an ai"`, `"i believe"`, `"i'm not sure"`, etc.) before being returned to the frontend. Any trigger is logged and flagged in the response payload for audit.

### PII detection — Microsoft Presidio

Every CV submitted is scanned by [Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/) before processing. Detected PII entities (names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.) are logged for audit — the CV content is not masked before reaching the LLM, as the review requires it, but every entity type is recorded so the system has a full audit trail of what personal data was processed.

### Chunk metadata

Every knowledge base chunk stored in ChromaDB carries a source filename, SHA-256 document hash, chunk index, and ingestion timestamp. This enables targeted deletes when documents change, a full audit trail for retrieved content, and blast-radius isolation if bad data enters the index.

The frontend and backend are deployed independently. The React app on Vercel calls the FastAPI backend on Render directly from the browser. CORS is configured on the backend to allow requests from the Vercel domain.

## Security

Security was treated as a first-class concern throughout the build, not something added at the end.

### Dependency and code scanning (CI gates)

Every push to `main` runs three automated security checks. The pipeline fails and blocks deployment if any of them report critical or high severity findings.

| Tool | What it scans | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | Python source code for common vulnerabilities (injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions) | Medium and above |
| [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) | Python dependencies against the OSV and PyPI Advisory databases | Any known CVE |
| [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) | Docker image (OS packages + Python packages installed in the container) | Critical and High (fixed only) |

### Vulnerability remediation history

The project has gone through multiple rounds of dependency hardening since initial build:

- Migrated from `PyPDF2` (deprecated, CVE-2023-36464) to `pypdf 6.10.2` which patches 25 DoS vulnerabilities in PDF parsing
- Upgraded `python-multipart` from 0.0.19 to 0.0.27, patching a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2026-24486) and a DoS vulnerability (CVE-2026-40347)
- Upgraded `python-dotenv` from 1.0.1 to 1.2.2, patching a symlink file overwrite vulnerability (CVE-2026-28684)
- Upgraded `FastAPI` from 0.115.6 to 0.136.3 to pull in `starlette 1.2.1`, patching a DoS via malformed Range headers (CVE-2025-62727)
- Upgraded `wheel` to 0.47.0 and `setuptools` to 82.0.1 to patch vendored dependency CVEs

### Secrets management

- The OpenAI API key lives in `.env` which is in `.gitignore` and never committed
- `.env.example` documents required variable names without values
- On Render, secrets are injected as environment variables at runtime, never baked into the image
- The Docker image is built from a `.dockerignore` that explicitly excludes `.env`, `.venv`, and the ChromaDB data folder

### Input validation

- All API request bodies are validated by Pydantic v2 before any processing occurs
- File uploads are validated for type (PDF and TXT only) and content (empty documents are rejected)
- Custom exception handlers return clean error messages without exposing stack traces or internal paths

## Roadmap

### Kubernetes (planned)
Once the Azure deployment is stable, the system will be migrated to Kubernetes for production-grade orchestration. This includes horizontal pod autoscaling, rolling updates, and a proper ingress controller with rate limiting.

### Terraform + Azure (planned)
Full Azure deployment managed with Terraform: Azure Container Registry, Azure Container App, Azure Key Vault for secrets, and Azure File Share for ChromaDB persistence.
### Add in a Cover letter feature (planned)
Generate personalised, ATS-aligned cover letters using candidate profiles, AI Matrix scoring, user preferences, and job descriptions to create tailored application content at scale.
