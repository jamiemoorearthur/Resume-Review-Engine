# CV Reviewer AI

An AI-powered CV review platform that analyses your resume against a real job description and returns structured, actionable feedback. Built with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, semantic search, and GPT-4o-mini to give feedback grounded in real hiring criteria - not generic advice.

| **Backend API** | [cv-reviewer-api.fly.dev/docs](https://cv-reviewer-api.fly.dev/docs) |

---

## What it does

Upload a CV (PDF) and paste a job description. The system returns:

```json
{
  "overall_score": 72,
  "ats_score": 68,
  "recruiter_score": 6,
  "category_scores": {
    "role_alignment": 75,
    "skills_match": 70,
    "experience_relevance": 65,
    "ats_keyword_match": 68,
    "bullet_point_quality": 60,
    "structure_readability": 80,
    "missing_evidence": 55
  },
  "role_alignment": "Good",
  "missing_keywords": ["Docker", "PostgreSQL"],
  "strengths": ["Strong Python and backend experience"],
  "weaknesses": ["No evidence of production deployment experience"],
  "section_recommendations": ["Add a Technical Skills section"],
  "suggested_bullets": [
    {
      "original": "Built AI chatbot using FastAPI",
      "improved": "Built and deployed a FastAPI-based AI chatbot handling 10k requests/day, reducing support queries by 22%."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response fields:**
- `overall_score` - weighted average across 7 rubric categories (0–100)
- `ats_score` - ATS keyword match score (0–100)
- `recruiter_score` - likelihood a recruiter shortlists this CV in a 6-second scan (0–10)
- `category_scores` - individual raw score for each of the 7 rubric categories before weighting
- `section_recommendations` - sections to add or remove based on the target role
- `suggested_bullets` - rewrites that scale with CV quality: 4–6 for weak CVs, 0–1 for strong CVs

---

## How it works

The system uses a RAG pipeline to ground every piece of feedback in a curated knowledge base rather than relying on the model's general knowledge alone.

```
CV (PDF)  +  Job Description (text)
        |
        v
  Text Extraction (pypdf)
        |
        v
  Chunking + Embedding (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
        |
        v
  ChromaDB Semantic Search
  (retrieves relevant rubric, ATS rules, bullet examples)
        |
        v
  GPT-4o-mini (CV + JD + retrieved context)
        |
        v
  Structured JSON Review
        |
        v
  React Frontend (scores, keywords, strengths, bullet rewrites)
```

![RAG Architecture](images/ragarch.PNG)

**Knowledge base sources loaded into ChromaDB at startup:**
- CV review rubric (7 scoring categories with weighted criteria)
- ATS guidelines (keyword strategy, formatting rules, score thresholds)
- Strong bullet point examples (before/after rewrites with structure rules)
- Role matching criteria (tech stack requirements by role across 7 job families)

## LLMOps

The pipeline is instrumented end-to-end with production-grade observability, evaluation, and guardrails.

### Observability - Langfuse

Every request is traced in [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/):

| Span | What is captured |
|---|---|
| **Trace** | CV length, JD length, prompt version - one trace per review request |
| **Retrieval span** | Chunks retrieved, chunks dropped by relevance threshold, distance scores |
| **Generation** | Full prompt sent to GPT, raw response, token usage, estimated cost per call |

### RAG evaluation - Ragas

A [Ragas](https://ragas.io/) evaluation suite runs against a golden dataset of synthetic CV/JD pairs every Monday at 9am UTC via GitHub Actions:

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| **Faithfulness** | Are review claims grounded in the retrieved knowledge base context? |
| **Answer Relevancy** | Is the feedback relevant to the specific CV and JD submitted? |
| **Context Precision** | Are the retrieved chunks actually useful for generating the answer? |
| **Context Recall** | Does the retrieved context cover everything in the expected answer? |

Run manually:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-eval.txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python tests/eval/run_eval.py
```

### Prompt versioning

System prompts live as versioned text files (`prompts/system_v1.0.0.txt`) and are loaded at runtime. The active version is set via `PROMPT_VERSION` and attached to every Langfuse trace - prompt changes can be correlated with score regressions without redeploying.

### Relevance threshold

Before any chunks reach the LLM, a cosine distance filter drops retrievals with distance > 0.8. Weak matches are logged in the Langfuse span so you can see exactly what the retriever discarded and why.

### Token and cost logging

After every GPT call, token usage and estimated cost are logged and attached to the Langfuse generation:

```
[tokens] prompt=1842 completion=312 total=2154 cost=$0.0005
```

### Output gate

The JSON response is scanned for hallucination markers (`"as an ai"`, `"i believe"`, `"i'm not sure"`) before being returned to the frontend. Any trigger is logged and flagged in the response payload for audit.

### PII detection - Microsoft Presidio

Every CV submitted is scanned by [Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/) before processing. Detected PII entities (names, emails, phone numbers) are logged for audit with a full record of what personal data was processed.

### Chunk metadata

Every ChromaDB chunk carries a source filename, SHA-256 document hash, chunk index, and ingestion timestamp - enabling targeted deletes when documents change and a full audit trail for retrieved content.

## Architecture

      | HTTPS POST /review (multipart/form-data)
      v
FastAPI Backend (Fly.io - always-on, London region)
      |
      |-- pypdf extracts CV text
      |-- ChromaDB retrieves relevant knowledge base chunks (persisted Fly volume)
      |-- GPT-4o-mini generates structured review
      |
      v
JSON response back to frontend
```

The frontend and backend are deployed independently. The React app on Vercel calls the FastAPI backend on Fly.io directly from the browser. CORS is configured on the backend to allow requests from the Vercel domain.

---

## Security

Security was treated as a first-class concern throughout the build, not something added at the end.

### Dependency and code scanning (CI gates)

Every push to `main` runs three automated security checks that block deployment on critical/high findings.

| Tool | What it scans | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | Python source code - injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions | Medium and above |
| [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) | Python dependencies against OSV and PyPI Advisory databases | Any known CVE |
| [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) | Docker image (OS packages + Python packages) | Critical and High (fixed only) |

### Vulnerability remediation history

- Migrated from `PyPDF2` (deprecated, CVE-2023-36464) to `pypdf` which patches 25+ DoS vulnerabilities in PDF parsing
- Bumped `pypdf` from `6.12.0` → `6.13.0` → `6.13.3` across three rounds of newly disclosed CVEs
- Upgraded `python-multipart` to patch path traversal (CVE-2026-24486) and DoS (CVE-2026-40347)
- Upgraded `python-dotenv` to patch symlink file overwrite (CVE-2026-28684)
- Upgraded `FastAPI` to pull in `starlette 1.2.1`, patching DoS via malformed Range headers (CVE-2025-62727)
- Upgraded `wheel` and `setuptools` to patch vendored dependency CVEs

### Secrets management

- `.env` is in `.gitignore` - never committed
- `.env.example` documents required variable names without values
- On Fly.io, secrets are injected as environment variables via `fly secrets set` - never baked into the image
- `CORS_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated env var parsed at runtime - no hardcoded origins in code

## API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |
| `POST` | `/upload` | Parse a CV file and return extracted text |
| `POST` | `/review` | Full AI review - scores, keywords, strengths, weaknesses, bullet rewrites |

## CI/CD

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | Push / PR to `main` | Run tests, Bandit, pip-audit, Docker build, Trivy scan, deploy to Fly.io |
| `eval.yml` | Monday 9am UTC | Ragas RAG evaluation against golden dataset |
| `aks-provision.yml` | Manual only | Bootstrap Terraform state storage, run `terraform apply` on Azure AKS |
| `aks-cd.yml` | Manual only | Build `linux/amd64` image, push to ACR, deploy to AKS |
| `aks-destroy.yml` | Manual (`confirm: DESTROY`) | Tear down all Azure resources |

The AKS workflows are manual-only and will not trigger automatically. They are ready for when the product migrates to Azure.
