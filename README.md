# CV Reviewer AI

An AI-powered CV review platform that analyses your resume against a real job description and returns structured, actionable feedback. Built with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, semantic search, and GPT-4o to give feedback that is grounded in real hiring criteria, not generic advice.

## Live API

The backend is live and publicly accessible. You can test the review endpoint directly from the browser using the interactive docs:

**[Try the API on Render](https://cv-reviewer-api.onrender.com/docs#/default/review_cv_review_post)**

> Note: The free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request may take 30 seconds to wake up.

## What it does

Upload a CV (PDF) and paste a job description. The system returns:

```json
{
  "overall_score": 75,
  "ats_score": 70,
  "role_alignment": "Good",
  "missing_keywords": ["Django", "PostgreSQL", "OpenAPI", "OAuth2"],
  "strengths": ["Strong Python and backend experience"],
  "weaknesses": ["No evidence of production daemon or background worker experience"],
  "suggested_bullets": [
    {
      "original": "Built AI chatbot using FastAPI",
      "improved": "Built and deployed a FastAPI-based AI chatbot with prompt-injection filtering, structured logging and Docker support, reducing customer queries by 22%."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## How it works

The system uses a RAG pipeline to ground every piece of feedback in a curated knowledge base rather than relying on the model's general knowledge alone.

```
CV (PDF)  +  Job Description (text)
        |
        v
  Text Extraction (pypdf)
        |
        v
  Chunking + Embedding (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
        |
        v
  ChromaDB Semantic Search
  (retrieves relevant rubric, ATS rules, bullet examples)
        |
        v
  GPT-4o-mini (CV + JD + retrieved context)
        |
        v
  Structured JSON Review
```

**Knowledge base sources loaded into ChromaDB at startup:**
- CV review rubric (7 scoring categories with weighted criteria)
- ATS guidelines (keyword strategy, formatting rules, score thresholds)
- Strong bullet point examples (before/after rewrites with structure rules)
- Role matching criteria (tech stack requirements by role across 7 job families)

## Security

Security was treated as a first-class concern throughout the build, not something added at the end.

### Dependency and code scanning (CI gates)

Every push to `main` runs three automated security checks. The pipeline fails and blocks deployment if any of them report critical or high severity findings.

| Tool | What it scans | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | Python source code for common vulnerabilities (injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe functions) | Medium and above |
| [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) | Python dependencies against the OSV and PyPI Advisory databases | Any known CVE |
| [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) | Docker image (OS packages + Python packages installed in the container) | Critical and High (fixed only) |

### Vulnerability remediation history

The project has gone through multiple rounds of dependency hardening since initial build:

- Migrated from `PyPDF2` (deprecated, CVE-2023-36464) to `pypdf 6.10.2` which patches 25 DoS vulnerabilities in PDF parsing
- Upgraded `python-multipart` from 0.0.19 to 0.0.27, patching a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2026-24486) and a DoS vulnerability (CVE-2026-40347)
- Upgraded `python-dotenv` from 1.0.1 to 1.2.2, patching a symlink file overwrite vulnerability (CVE-2026-28684)
- Upgraded `FastAPI` from 0.115.6 to 0.136.3 to pull in `starlette 1.2.1`, patching a DoS via malformed Range headers (CVE-2025-62727)
- Upgraded `wheel` to 0.47.0 and `setuptools` to 82.0.1 to patch vendored dependency CVEs

### Secrets management

- The OpenAI API key lives in `.env` which is in `.gitignore` and never committed
- `.env.example` documents required variable names without values
- On Render, secrets are injected as environment variables at runtime, never baked into the image
- The Docker image is built from a `.dockerignore` that explicitly excludes `.env`, `.venv`, and the ChromaDB data folder

### Input validation

- All API request bodies are validated by Pydantic v2 before any processing occurs
- File uploads are validated for type (PDF and TXT only) and content (empty documents are rejected)
- Custom exception handlers return clean error messages without exposing stack traces or internal paths

## API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |
| `POST` | `/upload` | Parse a CV file and return extracted text |
| `POST` | `/review` | Full AI review: scores, keywords, strengths, weaknesses, bullet rewrites |

## Running locally

**Requirements:** Python 3.11, an OpenAI API key

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jamiemoorearthur/Resume-Review-Engine.git
cd Resume-Review-Engine/backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
# or: source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your OpenAI key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env

# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. The knowledge base loads into ChromaDB on first startup (takes a few seconds and makes ~49 embedding API calls).

**Running with Docker:**
```bash
cd Resume-Review-Engine
docker-compose up --build
```

**Running tests:**
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Roadmap

### Frontend (in progress)
A React and TypeScript frontend is being built to give this a proper UI. The interface will include:
- CV file upload with drag-and-drop
- Job description input box
- Score cards with visual breakdowns
- Keyword gap analysis panel
- Before/after bullet rewrite display

### Terraform + Azure deployment (coming soon)
The backend currently runs on Render. The next infrastructure step is a full Azure deployment managed with Terraform:
- Azure Container Registry to host the Docker image
- Azure Container App for the backend service (auto-scaling, zero-downtime deploys)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure File Share for ChromaDB persistence
- `tfsec` / Trivy IaC scanning added to the CI pipeline

### Kubernetes (planned)
Once the Azure deployment is stable, the system will be migrated to Kubernetes for production-grade orchestration. This includes horizontal pod autoscaling, rolling updates, and a proper ingress controller with rate limiting.
